I: Four options for buildings that are present on the page (prototype)
O: Schematics and/or information on the different building types

 * * * LANDING PAGE * * *
The landing page will present with the district name and an address entry field
    for the purposes of the prototype/demo this will be replaced with a drop down menu with 4 options
        4 options:
        - Single family building
        - Industrial building
        - Commercial building
        - Multi family building

* * * MAIN PAGE * * *
After the user has selected an option they will be presented with the following information:
    Top leftt (possible header): address of the incident 
    bottom left: main map of the address
    Top Right: Responding, arriving and current units
    Bottom right (4 square grid): different angles of the building 
    Inbetween map and grid: building information 

User interaction:
    All GUI pieces will be elements that the user will be able to interact with.
        If they decide that the Map needs to be the main focus, they can resize
            resizing elements will affect other elements present on screen. 

* * * CSS * * *
Text: Simple to read plain text.
Color Scheme: Red and white with elements of black
Images: 
        Main elements such as the map and text will have small borders to minimize distraction while being able to provide the user a quick glance
        Side elements will have a slightly smaller border for quick ease of visual space
Image Behavior:
        The user will be able to resize and zoom in on elements as needed. 
        When one element takes over a majority of space the other elements will resize
        When one elment takes over the entire screen, all other elments will be hidden
            hidden elments will re appear once main image is resized smaller
